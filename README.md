# Self-RAG: Advanced Self-Reflective Retrieval-Augmented Generation System

## üöÄ Overview

Self-RAG is a cutting-edge Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture enhanced with a **self-reflective mechanism**.  
This system enables a language model not only to retrieve and generate an answer based on a knowledge base but also to **critically evaluate, critique, and iteratively improve its own responses** before delivering the final output.

The goal is to significantly improve **factual accuracy, coherence, and relevance** while minimizing hallucinations and errors typical of large language models.

## üéØ Key Objectives

- **Intelligent Retrieval**: Utilize vector search engines (FAISS, Chroma) to extract the most relevant documents from large knowledge bases.
- **Initial Generation**: Employ powerful language models (GPT-4, LLaMA, etc.) to produce a context-aware preliminary answer.
- **Self-Critical Evaluation**: Implement a module that analyzes the generated answer to detect factual mistakes, contradictions, or insufficient detail.
- **Iterative Refinement**: Generate an improved answer based on self-assessment feedback, iterating until a quality threshold is reached.
- **Modular & Extensible Pipeline**: Easily swap retrieval, LLM, and evaluation components.
- **Multi-Domain Applicability**: Virtual assistants, chatbots, Q&A systems, automated customer support, and more.

```
## Step-by-Step Breakdown

### Retrieval  
The system queries a vector index (FAISS or Chroma) using the query embedding and retrieves the top-k relevant documents.

### Initial Generation  
The retrieved documents serve as context for the LLM, which generates an initial response.

### Self-Evaluation  
- The generated answer is analyzed via a secondary LLM call or custom module to detect factual errors, inconsistencies, or lack of completeness.  
- A diagnostic report is produced about the answer quality.

### Refinement  
- If issues are detected, the refinement module feeds back these critiques to the LLM, prompting it to produce a corrected and enhanced answer.  
- Multiple iterations can occur until the answer meets quality criteria.

### Output  
The refined, high-quality answer is returned to the user.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher  
- OpenAI API key or equivalent LLM access  
- Virtual environment recommended (venv, conda)

### Steps

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Self_RAG.git
cd Self_RAG
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate     # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate.bat    # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Configuration

Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and add your API keys:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

```
Customize parameters in configs/config.yaml (e.g., number of retrieved documents, evaluation thresholds).

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage Example
Run the pipeline with a question:

```bash
python main.py --query "What are the impacts of climate change on biodiversity?"
Example output:
üîé Retrieving top 5 documents...
‚úçÔ∏è Generating initial answer...
üßê Performing self-evaluation...
‚ôªÔ∏è Refining the response...
‚úÖ Final answer ready:

Climate change impacts biodiversity by altering natural habitats, disrupting migratory patterns, and increasing species extinction risks...
```

## üß™ Testing & Quality Assurance

- Comprehensive unit tests for all modules.  
- End-to-end integration tests of the pipeline.  
- Code coverage analysis and continuous integration.  
- Validation of prompt effectiveness on various queries.
